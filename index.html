              to transform the short distance or last-mile commute and with that the positive impact on our carbon footprint.

            <p>“I use it for daily commute to the office, have taken more than 550 rides by now. With the saver packs, the commute becomes pretty
               affordable. Great for fun activities too. Most bikes are well maintained. #YuluingAway #YuluBikes #YuluCommutes"</p>
